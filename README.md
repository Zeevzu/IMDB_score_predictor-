# Predicting IMDB score from movieâ€™s trailer

In this project we attempt to use a Pre-trained model to predict from selected frames of a trailer, it's IMDB score.
We use Transfer-Learning by performing additional training on a pre-trained network, using the new dataset, to achieve this task.

This is a class project as part of EE046211 - Deep Learning course @ Technion.
