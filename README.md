In this project we attempt to use a Pre-trained model to predict from selected frames of a trailer, it's IMDB score.
We use Transfer-Learning by performing additional training on a pre-trained network, using the new dataset, to achieve this task.
The creation of this unique Dataset was made by scraping from the internet the trailers MP4 files and sampling frames from them.
This is a class project as part of EE046211 - Deep Learning course @ Technion.

## Background

As mentioned previously, the goal of the project is to obtain the IMDB score of a movie, based on it's trailer, As showed in the following block diagram.

The main constraints we made for this project is reasonable traning and inference time. Those constraints guided us to be more creative with the input of our model.
To have reasonable traning and inference time we used a pre-trained DNN model
