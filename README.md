# Predicting IMDB score from movie’s trailer

In this project we attempt to use a Pre-trained model to predict from selected frames of a trailer, it's IMDB score.
We use Transfer-Learning by performing additional training on a pre-trained network, using the new dataset, to achieve this task.
The creation of this unique Dataset was made by scraping from the internet the trailers MP4 files and sampling frames from them.
This is a class project as part of EE046211 - Deep Learning course @ Technion.
